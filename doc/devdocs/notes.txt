The (nt)driver decides a volume is a TC vol by identifying a signature with in the header. This signature is the TrueCrypt string, but the rebranding changed 
the constants, one or some of which created the string in the header. Now the code will have to look for CipherShed. To support legacy containers the code 
searches for CipherShed first, then TrueCrypt.

Thanks to Kyle for taking the time to narrow it down to a flag being zero which led to the discovery of the 4 sections of code relying on the "disk label".

The 4 areas are:
WriteBootSectorUserConfig

InstallBootLoader

TC_IOCTL_OPEN_TEST

TC_IOCTL_GET_SYSTEM_DRIVE_CONFIG
