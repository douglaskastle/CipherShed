Installed from manjaro-xfce-0.8.11-x86_64.iso, update firewall to allow 22, install ssh, add it to systemd, apply requested updates, reboot.

ssh in and run the following:

sudo mhwd-kernel -i linux312
sudo pacman -S git
sudo pacman -S nasm
sudo pacman -S wxgtk2.8
git clone https://github.com/CipherShed/CipherShed
cd CipherShed/src
WX_CONFIG=/usr/bin/wx-config-2.8 make

Then I ran ciphershed in the CipherShed/src/Main directory

I was able to create a vol, mount it write to it, dismount it, re-mount it and open the file.
